# Palindrome-Checker
Starting my javascript algorithms and data structures Projects with Palindrome-Checker.
Palindrome-Checker is a small JavaScript project, to check if a String is a Plindrome.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, 
ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
